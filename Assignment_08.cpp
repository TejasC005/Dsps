/*
A library needs to manage a collection of books (data fields such
as book title, author, ISBN, availability status, and other relevant
information), maintain information about each book, support
operations like adding, removing, and searching for books, and
provide efficient access to library resources. Use the Concept of
Linked List for implementation of Library Management system.
